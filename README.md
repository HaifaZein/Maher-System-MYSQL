# Database Project Documentation

## Overview
This documentation details the development of a database system using SQL for the **Maher Development System**, an information system designed for professional training management at **Prince Sultan University (PSU)**. The project follows a structured approach to database design, implementation, and query execution.

## Project Phases
### **Phase 1: System Analysis & Requirements**
- **Information System Description**: The **Maher Development System** was conceptualized to facilitate professional training registration and tracking for PSU faculty members.
- **Requirement Gathering**: Data and functional requirements were elicited through interviews with PSU staff and faculty.
- **Key Features**:
  - User registration and authentication
  - Activity management and participation tracking
  - Training points and certification system
  - Evaluation and feedback functionality

### **Phase 2: ER/EER Modeling**
- **Entity-Relationship (ER) and Enhanced ER (EER) Diagrams**: Created to define entities, attributes, and relationships.
- **Business Rules**:
  - Faculty members can register for multiple training activities.
  - Training activities can be conducted at multiple locations.
  - Each faculty member earns points for participation, contributing to professional growth.
  - Departments manage training activities and track attendance.

### **Phase 3: Database Design & Normalization**
- **Data Dictionary**: Structured entity definitions including attributes, data types, and constraints.
- **Relational Schema**: The EER model was mapped into a normalized relational schema.
- **Normalization**: Ensured optimal database structure by reducing redundancy and enforcing data integrity.

### **Phase 4: SQL Implementation**
- **Database Creation**: Tables were implemented using **Oracle SQL** with primary and foreign key constraints.
- **Data Insertion**: Sample data was inserted for testing purposes.
- **Security & Integrity**:
  - Role-based access control.
  - Constraints on user data modifications.

### **Phase 5: SQL Queries**
- **Simple Queries**:
  - Retrieve faculty members by department.
  - Sort faculty members based on rank.
  - Display training activity details.
- **Advanced Queries**:
  - Retrieve faculty members who have not participated in training.
  - Find the most active participant based on earned points.
  - Identify the department managed by a specific faculty member.
  - Calculate the average, minimum, and maximum scores for training evaluations.

## Results & Evaluation
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Query execution was optimized for performance.
  - Indexing was applied where necessary for faster retrieval.
- **System Integrity & Security**:
  - Enforced data validation rules.
  - Ensured compliance with **IEEE & ACM ethical guidelines** for data security and privacy.

## Conclusion & Future Enhancements
- Expanding the system to integrate **real-time activity tracking**.
- Implementing **role-based dashboards** for department administrators.
- Enhancing security measures for sensitive faculty data.
- Exploring **machine learning** for training recommendations.

This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide to the development and implementation of the Maher Development System database project.
